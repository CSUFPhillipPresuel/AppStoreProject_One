My first iOS app!

This app is a sort of "portfolio" for my clients's business. My client recently got certified to be an esthetician, a skin care professional, and I made her something she can use to advertise herself and her services. For more background, estheticians perform facials, waxes, massages, extractions, and other services. I had to discuss and collaborate with her to create an "About Me" and "Education" portion in the app to give the user some background and ensure the user that they'd be right in choosing her for any services. I aimed to layout all the services, with descriptions, she currently offers in an intuitive user-interface that is elegant and sleek. I had some specifications and requests to adhere to, making the app more "feminine" because her most typical clientele is female for example. I included her business email, as she is only accepting inquiries through email and has not yet started building her social media presence. Finally, for full context, this app was originally made for a school project in my final year at CSUF in a course centered around iOS mobile application development.
