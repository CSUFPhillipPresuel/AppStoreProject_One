My first iOS app!

This app is a sort of "portfolio" for my clients's business. My client recently got certified to be an esthetician, a skin care professional, and I made her something she can use to advertise herself and her services. For more background, estheticians perform facials, waxes, massages, extractions, and other services. They can get more certifications and specializations to further their practice and this adds to the fact that I had to make the app scalable and I would have to be maintaining it constantly. I had to discuss and collaborate with her to create an "About Me" and "Education" portion in the app to give the user some background and ensure the user that they'd be right in choosing her for any services. I laid out all the services, with descriptions, she currently offers in an intuitive user-interface that is elegant and sleek. I had some specifications and requests, like making the app more "feminine" because of course her average client would most often be a female. I included her business email, as she is only accepting inquiries through email and has not yet started building social media presence. Make sure to checkout the app, SkinByAnaLaura! I am proud of what I made and am looking forward to building the app out even more. Finally, for full context, this app was made for a school project in my final year at CSUF.
